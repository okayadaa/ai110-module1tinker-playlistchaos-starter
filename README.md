Week 1 Tinker:

The core concept that students need to understand is how to articulate a prompt for AI. When working with AI, you have to be cautious and specify exactly what you want to target in order to resovle small bugs or features misbehaivng. Students should manage their time with familiarizing themselves how the app is supposed to operate and have awareness where logic seems off. Especially when the UI is puzzling. I believe the section where a student might mostly struggle with is classifying a song and searching songs function (on playlist_logic). AI was somewhat misleading on classifiying a song because when user would input a song and the energy would set to 2, it ended up in "hype" playlist. Which was incorrect. However, AI was very helpful in explaining how a specific code operates and could set examples how this code plays a role in it. In addition, one way I would guide the student without giving them the answer is analyze the code first, point out if the logic is correct or incorrect and have AI explain what the code does (to view if the student understands the code and if it's correct). Lastly, have the student construct a prompt to debug the code.
